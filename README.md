# Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Attention (Improved)

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for multivariate time-series forecasting:
- Data loading & preprocessing (scaling, sliding windows)
- Baseline LSTM model
- Transformer-based model with positional encoding and encoder-decoder options
- Training, evaluation across short/medium/long horizons
- Simple hyperparameter grid search example
- Plots and report included
